The following are some notes intended for developers.


1. Generating PDF documentation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can generate a printable PDF of the documentation by executing the
following commands from the main ibex directory:

    runhaskell GoCoWiToTex.hs docs/manual.txt IBEX_VERSION >docs/manual.tex
    cd docs
    pdflatex manual.tex

In order for the 'runhaskell' command to work, you may need to install
the following Haskell packages first:

    cabal install regex-posix
    cabal install regex-compat
    cabal install parsec

Executing the first set of commands should create docs/manual.pdf.
The automatic conversion is still a little buggy in places, but the
resulting PDF is pretty usable.

To do this, you'll need:

    * A standard LaTeX install (with all the usual packages).

    * GHC (Haskell compiler). http://www.haskell.org/ghc


2. Packaging a release.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to:

    * Run server.py with the --genhtml option to generate
      'experiment.html' and 'overview.html' in www/. For example, if
      you are in www/:

          python server.py --genhtml ./

    * Execute the following command from the root dir of the repo:

          sh mkdist.sh 0.3-beta-1234
